# beth-stack-todo
A simple TODO app built using the BETH stack: [Bun](https://bun.sh/) runtime, [ElysiaJS](https://elysiajs.com/) web framework, ~~[Turso](https://turso.tech/) DB~~ and [HTMX](https://htmx.org/).

Link to the tutorial that I followed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpzowDDJj24&ab_channel=EthanNiser. 

> **Notes after implementation:** Elysia JS was fun and straightforward to work with. Bun is ineeded a very fast batteries-included runtime. I did not integrate Turso DB - my main focus was to get in touch with HTMX.
